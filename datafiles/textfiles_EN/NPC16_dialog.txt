Hello Ed, what are you doing here?
Hello Ed, what are you doing here?
Oh, you said you sent it from the guild?
It was a car that needed help, but I'm glad I did.
Investigating found an anomaly in this upper cave
It seems that a strange goblin has appeared
One of the investigators got caught in a trap and was injured.
I had to go back to the village once.
If possible, may I ask you to check the cave instead?
If you're feeling hungry, how about a bowl of soup?
You've returned safely!
There's a big goblin inside the cave
You said you came down?
You did a really good job
We will return after completing the follow-up investigation.
I'll give you a transfer seat to Kakariko here.
With this, you can go back comfortably
Thank you for your research cooperation!
