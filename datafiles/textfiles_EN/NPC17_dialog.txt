Domo.
If you ask me my name, I'm a ninja
You made it all the way here
To celebrate finding me, let me tell you a technique.
Of course not for free
How about 200G
Originally, it's a skill that can't be learned even if you pay 10,000 gold.
Bring 200G to learn skills
well thought out
It's a useful skill to get through enemies quickly.
So see you next time

What a beautiful day
