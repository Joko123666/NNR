Welcome guests, is this your first time?
I am a merchant who sells items necessary for travel.
We will give you this item as a commemoration of our meeting.
Please select the product you want
Welcome to the Jeruluk Shop!
New to Jeruluk?
The specialty of Jeruluk is, of course, red ore!
However, since there are no processing facilities here,
There is no point in buying red ore unless you are a trader.
Instead, we recommend quality explosives and recovery drugs.
Please choose the one you want
Please handle explosives carefully.
Business here is really bad.
Are you selling red quartz?
Red quartz is always purchased at a high price.
I bought it for 1000G of red quartz.
Please do it again next time~
Welcome
This is a merchant on a business trip at the request of the guild.

This is a reasonable price for a business trip.
If you buy it now, your gratitude is free~
