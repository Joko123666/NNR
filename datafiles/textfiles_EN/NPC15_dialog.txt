hello id
A while ago, an abnormal situation was reported in the mountains.
An investigation team set out to investigate it
If you ever meet in the middle
Is it okay if I ask for your cooperation?
The survey team set out to the east
Welcome Mr. Ed

Did you find something strange?
Can you show me one more time?

Um... Right now I have no way of knowing what this is.
The guild will investigate this as well.
I'll let you know as soon as I find out something
Thank you very much for your cooperation in this investigation.
This is the reward in the guild
